                <p>I am Karthik Sama, a final year undergrad student at IIIT, Bangalore. I am enrolled in an Integrated Masters program in Computer Science. I love math!.
                Cognitive Neuroscience, Climate Change and Social welfare are the anchors along which I would like to contribute to society. The opening page was an attempt to visualize what I love.
                I also enjoy directionless discussions and solving puzzles.
