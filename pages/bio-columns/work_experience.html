            Worked on improving the performance of a system that re-constructs latent space dynamics of a dynamical system - FMRI recordings under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Durstewitz.
            Studied Sequential Variational Autoencoders(SVAEs) used in this pipeline to understand the encoding process and experimented the use of CNNs and RNNs to improve the latency of the encoding part of the system.
